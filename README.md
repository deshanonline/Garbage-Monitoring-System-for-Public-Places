The Paper IoT-based waste monitoring system is a very innovative system that helps clean 
cities. A web page makes it easy for administrators to know the bin storage capacity. An ultrasonic 
sensor is placed in the trash bin to detect the trash phase and balance the trash intensity with this 
system. The system sends data using a Raspberry Pi Backend server. Users can use a web page to 
locate the garbage bin area. An image view of the trash bins is provided on the web page and 
highlights the accumulated trash in colour to indicate the trash collection phase. This method helps 
keep the city clean by providing a graphical image of the garbage through the IoT Web 
development platform and notifying about the garbage level. This system only can be identify the 
garbage bin trash levels and all garbage bins can view their trash levels using single portal.
